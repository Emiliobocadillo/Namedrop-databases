

A RDBMS (Relational database management systems) is ACID compliant meaning that it has the following properties:

-Atomicity, meaning that a transaction with the database will happen in its entirity or not at all.
-Consistency, meaning that a transaction must follow the rules of the database.
-Isolation, meaning that the database can handle multiple concurrent processes without them interfering with eachother.
-Durabillity, meaning data is saved after each completed transaction.

6 examples of RDBMS:
-MySQL
-PostgreSQL
-Microsoft SQL Server
-Oracle Database
-MariaDB
-SQLite


Other types of databases:

- Key-value databases store data in the RAM and the access is therefor extremely fast. 
The trade off is the limited amount of space. Examples: Redis, Memcached.
- Document databases store and queries data as JSON-like documents to make it easier
for developers to interact with the database using the same format as they do in their application code. Example: Mongo DB.
-Columnar databases store data in columns as opposed to rows. Columnar databases can be relational. Example: Amazon redshift. 
-Graph databases are useful for heavily interconnected data. Example: Neo4j.
